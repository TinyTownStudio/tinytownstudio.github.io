## Design Style

- Minimal, monochromatic color scheme (white and grays)
- Use whitespace generously for clarity and legibility
- Typography defines hierarchy and importance; use bold for headings,
  micro-labels for context
- Navigation and footer links are simple, spaced, and stack vertically on mobile
- Use micro-labels (small, uppercase, letter-spaced text) for section and
  feature labels
- Use small circular dot elements for visual accents and to draw attention
- Features are presented in a grid, which collapses to a single column on mobile
- All content is wrapped in a `.container` with a max-width for readability
- Responsive design: adapts layout, font sizes, and spacing for smaller screens
- No heavy shadows or borders; use subtle box-shadows and rounded corners only
  for cards
- Buttons and links have clear touch targets and hover states
- Semantic HTML structure for SEO (header, main, section, article, footer)
- Accessibility: use `aria-label` where needed, ensure good contrast
